A real time chat application using React, Express, and Socket.io

Day 1: I got the mvp working, using express and socket.io to setup the server. As soon as the user connects, the backend gives it a username and it is shown on the app. When someone disconnects, it prints the disconnection method to the console. Each message is shown through the emit command. I'm planning on adding custom usernames, number of online users currently & adding rooms/channels (like discord) tomorrow. That's it for day 1.
